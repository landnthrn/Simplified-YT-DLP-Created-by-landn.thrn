YT-DLP SIMPLIFIED COMMANDS  
By landn.thrn

YT-DLP Commands made simple!  
Configured to download at the Highest Quality only 
36 different variations to download by  
 
Video related commands download encoded to MP4 by default for editor's use and compatibility with most applications  
If you wish to downloaded non-encoded then add `-orig` at the end of any command

You can easily change the command names if you'd like, it's as simple as renaming the command `.bat` files

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

INSTALLING YT-DLP & FFMPEG:

(There's a number of ways you can do this  
All of which will still work with these Simplified Commands, but I suggest  
using this simple way provided, as downloading in another way would require  
you to change the yt-dlp & ffmpeg install path locations in the `configs` `.txt` files)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SIMPLE WINGET INSTALL METHOD:

—  Open Windows PowerShell  

—  Run the command:  
   Winget search yt-dlp  

—  Copy the first ID you see  

—  Type:  
   Winget install <paste the ID>  

—  Hit Enter  

—  Let it finish installing  

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NOW SAME PROCESS FOR FFMPEG:

—  Run:  
   Winget search ffmpeg

—  Copy the first ID  

—  Type:  
   Winget install <paste the ID>

—  Hit Enter  

—  Let it finish installing  

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ONCE YT-DLP & FFMPEG ARE INSTALLED:

—  Open a File Explorer tab

—  Go to this path location   
   C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WinGet\Packages\  

—  Click into the folders until you find the ffmpeg bin folder, open the bin folder and copy the path address of the folder

—  In the `yt-dlp-commands` folder from this pack, open the `configs` folder  

—  Open `yt-dlp-encode.txt` and find this line at bottom:  
   --ffmpeg-location "C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WinGet\Packages\Gyan.FFmpeg_Microsoft.Winget.Source_8wekyb3d8bbwe\ffmpeg-7.1.1-full_build\bin" 

—  With the ffmpeg path location address you copied, paste it inbetween the quotation marks of that line
   It's very character sensitive so make sure you've pasted it correctly and no other changes were made to the `.txt`  

—  Do the same thing for the `yt-dlp-no-encode.txt`

—  Save & Close the `.txt` documents  

—  Open File Explorer

—  Create a folder titled `yt-dlp-commands` wherever you perfer (If you change it's location later you will have to update path's, keep in mind)
   (Recommend making a folder in Documents, title it `Scripts` and create it in there like this `Documents\Scripts\yt-dlp-commands`)

—  Place the all of the files & the `configs` folder from this download into the `yt-dlp-commands` folder you made

—  Copy the path address of the `yt-dlp-commands` folder where you have it 

—  Windows search for Environment Varibles

—  System Properties will likely open so click Environment Varibles  

—  In the User Varibles top box select Path > Edit > New  

—  Paste the path address you copied of the `yt-dlp-commands` folder location

—  Click OK > OK > OK to close Environment Variables  

—  Open command prompt  

—  Type `dl-help`  

ENJOY :)  

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TROUBLESHOOTING:
If you're having trouble,
—  Verify that when `yt-dlp.exe` was installed through Winget if it put it in your User Path's in Environment Varibles
   The path would look something like this `C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WinGet\Packages\yt-dlp.yt-dlp_Microsoft.Winget.Source_GUILDIDHERE`
—  Make sure all URL's you paste in commands are wrapped in quotations like "this"
—  Ensure there are no folder path mismatches in the two config files, or in the command `.bat`'s 
—  Update YT-DLP to the latest version, read instructions below
—  Update FFMPEG to the latest version, read instructions below

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

HOW TO UPDATE YT-DLP:

It's simple as running a command in Command Prompt,
"C:\THE-FULL-FILE-PATH-LOCATION-OF-YOUR\yt-dlp.exe" -U

If you don't know where your `yt-dlp.exe` is located, you can use Everything Searcher (a lifesaver tool highly recommend)

If you installed by Winget as instructed you can find it here:

—  Go to this path address in file explorer  
   C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WinGet\Packages\  

—  Find the `yt-dlp` folder

—  Copy the path address of that location and add ` \yt-dlp.exe ` at the end  

—  Wrap that full path with quotations like  
   "C:\Thepath\yt-dlp.exe"  

—  Open command prompt  

—  Paste the path, then type -U at the end and enter  

So in the end the update command should look like this:  
"C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WinGet\Packages\yt-dlp.yt-dlp_Microsoft.Winget.Source_8wekyb3d8bbwe\yt-dlp.exe" -U 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

HOW TO UPDATE FFMPEG: (If installed by Winget as intructed)

—  Open Windows PowerShell  

—  Run this command:  
   Winget search ffmpeg  

—  Copy the first ID you see  

—  Run this:  
   Winget upgrade <paste the ID>   

—  Hit Enter  

—  Let it finish updating  

After updating, you may need to update the FFMPEG path in your config files if the version number in the path changed

You can check by looking at the FFMPEG path address saved in the config files and compare it to the current one that is located here
C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WinGet\Packages\

If the version numbers at the end of the path differ, correct it in the config files
