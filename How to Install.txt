YT-DLP Simplified Commands
By landn.thrn

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

INSTALLING YT-DLP & FFMPEG:

(There's a number of ways you can do this 
all of which will still work with these Simplified Commands, but I suggest
using this simple way provided, as downloading in another way would require
you to change the yt-dlp & ffmepg install path locations in the configs .txt files)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Simple Winget Install Method :

Open Windows Powershell

Run the command ' Winget search yt-dlp ' 

Copy the first ID you see 

Type ' Winget Install <paste the ID> ' Hit enter

Let it finish installing

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now same process for FFMEG:

Run ' Winget search ffmeg ' 

Copy the first ID 

Type ' Winget Install <paste the ID> ' Hit enter ' 

Let it finish installing

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ONCE YT-DLP & FFMEPG ARE INSTALLED:

Open File Explorer, clear the address in the path address bar, 

Type %appdata% hit enter

Drag the yt-dlp folder from this pack into your Appdata/Roaming 
(replace if that folder is already there)
(if you happen to have your own created yt-dlp configs in a folder titled the same, then don't replace & lose your own configs of course)

Open yt-dlp-encode.txt inside the yt-dlp folder, keep this tab open for now

Open another File Explorer tab, clear the address path bar

Paste this path location in the path address bar '  C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WinGet\Packages\  ' and Hit enter

Click into the folders you see until you find the ffmpeg bin folder, open the bin folder and then copy the current path location in the File Explorer address bar

In the yt-dlp-encode.txt you have open, find this line at bottom :
 '  --ffmpeg-location "C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WinGet\Packages\Gyan.FFmpeg_Microsoft.Winget.Source_8wekyb3d8bbwe\ffmpeg-7.1.1-full_build\bin"  ' 

With the ffmpeg path location address you copied, paste it inbetween the "the apostrophes of that line like this"

Coding is very character sensitive so make sure you've pasted it correctly and no other changes were made to the .txt

Open the yt-dlp-no-encode.txt and paste the same address in the same place just the same

Save & Close the .txt documents

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now open your computer Documents folder 

Drag the dlpSimplified-Commands folder into your documents

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Open Windows search, find and open Environment Variables

In the top retangle box select Path, and click Edit and then New

Paste this path address '   C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Documents\dlpSimplified-Commands   ' 

Replace the '  %USERNAME%  ' part with the name of your computer user 
(if you don't know the name of your user, open File Explorer > My PC > Local Disk C: > Users > You will see a folder with the name of your user)
So say if it was Elephant, then the path address for the varible would be C:\Users\Elephant\Documents\dlpDownloader-commands

Click Ok to close Environment Variables

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Open command prompt and type yt-help

ENJOY :)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

IMPORTANT INFO:

All video related commands download re-encoded to MP4 so that downloads are compatible in editing software.

If you aren't downloading to edit with but more so just to view, then type the number '  8  ' before any command
and it will install as original & non-encoded. For Example  ~  8yt-vid 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TROUBLESHOOTING:

If you're having any sort of issue it is likely due to a path location that needs a small tweak in one (or maybe more) of these areas

The 2 .txt files in your yt-dlp folder 

Envoriment Varibles > Path > Edit 

Very unlikely that anything would need to be tweaked in the dlpSimplified-Commands folder

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

DISCLAIMER:

Changing names, and locations of these files to your own liking will require you to update/change the path locations in the files & in Enviorment Varibles
So just leave the files as they are, and place them in the previously instructed areas no where else.
