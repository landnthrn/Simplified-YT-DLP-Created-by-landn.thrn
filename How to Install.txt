YT-DLP Simplified Commands
By landn.thrn

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

INSTALLING YT-DLP & FFMPEG:

(There's a number of ways you can do this 
All of which will still work with these Simplified Commands, but I suggest
using this simple way provided, as downloading in another way would require
you to change the yt-dlp & ffmepg install path locations in the configs .txt files)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Simple Winget Install Method :

Open Windows Powershell

Run the command ' Winget search yt-dlp ' 

Copy the first ID you see 

Type ' Winget Install <paste the ID> ' Hit enter

Let it finish installing

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now same process for FFMEG:

Run ' Winget search ffmeg ' 

Copy the first ID 

Type ' Winget Install <paste the ID> ' Hit enter ' 

Let it finish installing

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ONCE YT-DLP & FFMEPG ARE INSTALLED:

Press Win + R 

Type %appdata% hit enter

Drag the yt-dlp folder from this pack into your Appdata/Roaming 
(replace if that folder is already there)
(if you happen to have your own created yt-dlp configs in a folder titled the same, then don't replace & lose your own configs of course)

Open yt-dlp-encode.txt inside the yt-dlp folder, keep this tab open for now

Open another File Explorer tab, clear the address path bar

Paste this path location in the path address bar '  C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WinGet\Packages\  ' and Hit enter

Click into the folders you see until you find the ffmpeg bin folder, open the bin folder and then copy the current path location in the File Explorer address bar

In the yt-dlp-encode.txt you have open, find this line at bottom :
 '  --ffmpeg-location "C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WinGet\Packages\Gyan.FFmpeg_Microsoft.Winget.Source_8wekyb3d8bbwe\ffmpeg-7.1.1-full_build\bin"  ' 

With the ffmpeg path location address you copied, paste it inbetween the "the apostrophes of that line like this"

Coding is very character sensitive so make sure you've pasted it correctly and no other changes were made to the .txt

Open the yt-dlp-no-encode.txt and paste the same address in the same place just the same

Save & Close the .txt documents

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now open your Documents folder 

Drag the dlpSimplified-Commands folder into your documents

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Open Windows search, find open Environment Variables

Click Environment Varibles

In the top retangle box (User Variables) select Path, then Edit, then New

Paste this path address '   C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Documents\dlpSimplified-Commands   ' 

Replace the '  %USERNAME%  ' part with the name of your computer user 
(if you don't know the name of your user, open File Explorer > My PC > Local Disk C: > Users > You will see a folder with the name of your user)
So say if it was Elephant, then the path address for the varible would be C:\Users\Elephant\Documents\dlpDownloader-commands

Click Ok a few times to close Environment Variables

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Open command prompt and type yt-help

ENJOY :)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

IMPORTANT INFO:

All video related commands download re-encoded to MP4 so that downloads are compatible in editing software.

If you aren't downloading to edit with but more so just to view, then type the number '  8  ' before any command
and it will install as original & non-encoded. For Example  ~  8yt-vid 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TROUBLESHOOTING:

If you're having any sort of issue it is likely due to a path location that needs a small tweak in one (or maybe more) of these areas

- The 2 .txt files in your yt-dlp folder located in Appdata\Roaming

- Envoriment Varibles > Path > Edit 

Or you may be having issues because your YT-DLP may not be up to date

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

HOW TO UPDATE YT-DLP (If installed by Winget as instructed)

Go to this path address in file explorer 
C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WinGet\Packages\

Find the yt-dlp folder and enter it

Copy the path address of that location and add '  \yt-dlp.exe   ' at the end

Wrap that full path with quotations like "C:\Thepath\yt-dlp.exe" 

Open command prompt

Paste the path, then type -U at the end and enter

So in the end the update command should look like this:

"C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WinGet\Packages\yt-dlp.yt-dlp_Microsoft.Winget.Source_8wekyb3d8bbwe\yt-dlp.exe" -U
